## Notes for other Developers
* Development branch is the cutting edge but possibly broken branch.  Master is the most stable but out of date.
* Gradle is a real pain to work with.  However, if you have trouble loading this project, I used Gradle v4.10.3.
* The file Settings.java contains various settings that can be changed.


## Licence
This project uses the MIT licence.  See LICENCE.txt.
